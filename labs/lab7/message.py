        #            form as found in the .torrent file, which is identical to bdecoding the metainfo file, extracting
        #            the info dictionary and encoding it if and only if the bdecoder fully validated the input
        #            (e.g. key ordering, absence of leading zeros). Conversely that
        #            means clients must either reject invalid metainfo files or extract the substring directly.
        #            They must not perform a decode-encode roundtrip on invalid data.
        #      peer_id
        #            A string of length 20 which this downloader uses as its id. Each downloader generates its own id at
        #            random at the start of a new download. This value will also almost certainly have to be escaped.
        #      ip
        #            An optional parameter giving the IP (or dns name) which this peer is at. Generally used for the
        #            origin if it's on the same machine as the tracker.
        #      port
        #            The port number this peer is listening on. Common behavior is for a downloader to try to listen
        #            on port 6881 and if that port is taken try 6882, then 6883, etc. and give up after 6889.
        #      uploaded
        #            The total amount uploaded so far, encoded in base ten ascii.
        #      downloaded
        #            The total amount downloaded so far, encoded in base ten ascii.
        #      left
        #            The number of bytes this peer still has to download, encoded in base ten ascii. Note that this
        #            can't be computed from downloaded and the file length since it might be a resume, and there's a
        #            chance that some of the downloaded data failed an integrity check and had to be re-downloaded.
        #      event

        #            same as not being present). If not present, this is one of the announcements done at regular
        #            intervals. An announcement using started is sent when a download first begins, and one using
        #            completed is sent when the download is complete. No completed is sent if the file was complete
        #            when started. Downloaders send an announcement using stopped when they cease downloading.
