# Author:           Jose Ortiz
# Purpose:          CSC645 Assigment #1 TCP socket programming
# Description:      Template ClientHandler class. You are free to modify this
#                   file to meet your own needs. Additionally, you are
#                   free to drop this client handler class, and use a version of yours instead.
# Running:          Python 2: python server.py
#                   Python 3: python3 server.py
#                   Note: Must run the server before the client.
