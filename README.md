# CSC645 Spring 2020 Computer Networks
Welcome to Computer Networks!. Please modify this README file with the following info: 
1. Your name, and student id here
2. Update this table of assignments. Set to done after one of the assignments is completed:

| Assignment               | Completed     |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Lab 0                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 1                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 2                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 3                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 4                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 5                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 6                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 7                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 8                    | not done yet  |
| Lab 9                    | not done yet  |
| TCP Client/Server Network| not done yet  |
| P2P Decentralized Network| not done yet  |
| EC1                      | not done yet  |
| EC2                      | not done yet  |

If a lab, project or EC is not set to done at grading time, it won't be graded. The first thing I do when grading assignments is to see the above table. 

## Please read carefully all the projects, labs, and extracredit assignments guidelines described in this README file. Failure to follow them, may affect negatively your grade. 

# General Labs Guidelines:

* In this class students will implement ten programming labs.

* Programming labs will help you to understand concepts related to computer networks that are needed in the implementation of your projects in this class.  

* Read carefully both README files related to labs, and documentation inside .py files. 

* Labs must be done individually. However, group work is encoraged to help other students. In addition, the instructor will help if a students are stuck in a problem or they have questions.

* All labs must be implemented during class time, and must be commited to the repository by 9:45 pm. The only exceptions to this rule are labs 1 and 2 (take home labs).

* All the commits to the students' remote repository must be done during class time. Commits done after class won't be taken into consideration for grading purposes.

* If you miss a lab, you'll get a 0 in that lab. (no exceptions here)

* In all labs, you must implement only the parts marked as TODO. Some parts of the labs will be already implemented by the instructor. 

* Some labs contain unit tests, so you can test if your output is correct before submitting. For labs that do not contain unit tests, sample output or additional intructions will be provided in the README file located in each lab folder. 

* Labs are graded based on their completness and correctness. 

* Commenting in your code is recommended and encouraged, but not required due to the obvious time constraint. 

* Each lab has its own README file with specific docs and instructions.

* Failure to follow the labs rules may affect negatively your grade.

# General Projects Guidelines. 

* In this class students will implement two big programming projects; TCP Client-Server and P2P Decentralized Networks. 

* Projects are individual work. However, group work is encoraged to help other students.

* Students will be provided with enough time to complete the projects assigned in this class. Project's due dates will be informed by the instructor in class, by email, and posted on iLearn. 

* Code commited after project deadlines won't be taken into consideration for grading purposes. (no exceptions here)

* Projects in this class apply strong OOP design. So, make sure that you are familiar with the general programing concepts of abstraction, inheritance, polimorphysim, and encapsulation. 

* Students must provide complete documentation for each project (README file, and code commented) 

* Failure to provide docs will result in a 30% deduction from your grade in the project.

* If your project does not run, you'll get a 0 in that project. (no exceptions here). So, test your code accordely before commiting it to your master branch.

# General Extra-Credit Projects Guidelines. 

* In this class students will implement two optional extra-credit programming projects; Forwarding and Link State protocols. 

* Each extra-credit project is 3% worth that will be added to your final grade. 

* Extra-credit projects are all or nothing. No partial credit will be given. So, make sure that you plan accordely and understand the required project specifications before starting the implementation of one of them.
